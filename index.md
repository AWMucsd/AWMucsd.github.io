Welcome to the undergraduate chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics at UCSD! Our goals for this chapter are to build a community, provide mentorship, and support academic and professional goals for our members. AWM is inclusive of all genders and majors, but our main focus is to support the success of gender minorities in the math field.
